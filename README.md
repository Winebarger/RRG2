# Red River Gorge Project 
## GEO 409 in Fall of 2019

This project explores the uses of Arc Pro and Python to create products featuring a few landmarks in the Red River Gorge

Red River Gorge is located in eastern Kentucky in the Daniel Boone National Forest. It is world-renowned for its rock climbing and geological features!

(Note: files are referenced differently on the web. First, we always use the `/` forward slash in the path name to separate directories. Windows can use either but our scripts should use `\\`. URLs are case senstive. And, the file can be referenced as a relative path name. Check out [this description of path names](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/tools/supplement/pathnames-explained-absolute-relative-unc-and-url.htm).)
